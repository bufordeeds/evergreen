# Introduction

Empty states occur where there is no data to display to the user. Typically this happens while a user is setting up or using the product for the first time. However, empty states can also occur when data is deleted or unavailable.

A successful empty state in Segment should:
- Keep users informed and on track
- Remain consistent across the app to ensure a smooth experience
- Take into account the context of the user’s current situation

Possible elements of an empty state:
1. Border
2. Background
3. Visual 
4. Headline copy. Use headline copy to explain the situation at hand.
5. Body copy (optional). Use body copy to direct users and clearly explain the next action to populate the space.
6. Primary CTA (optional). The action on the page users can use to leave the state.
7. Text link (optional). Additional user support, like reference documents.
 

### Base empty state: in-table
Maintain table header, background color, and outline for in-table empty states.

### Base empty state: non-table
Include background color and outline for non-table empty states.

### Small empty state
Use for small use cases such as drop downs and overlays.

### Minimum viable empty state
While every empty state does not need to include all elements in the base, every empty state should include, at minimum, a visual and headline copy.

### CTA rules
- Use a primary button if the CTA allows the user to resolve the empty state on the page.
- In first time use scenarios, hide top line primary button and search box to avoid redundancy and confusion.
- Use a text link if the CTA provides additional information or resources outside Segment but does not allow the user to resolve the empty state.

### Copy rules
- Headline copy should never exceed 1 line, body copy should not exceed 2 lines. In all cases, try to make copy as succinct as possible.
- Tone is intentional, suggestive, and friendly. Tone is not jargon-y, superfluous, or opaque. 
- Use to headline copy to try and explain the situation at hand, and body copy to offer solutions. Use humor like an accent color — sparingly and to delightful effect. Context is key, ie; humor may be appropriate for a loading state or health check but not for permission gating.
